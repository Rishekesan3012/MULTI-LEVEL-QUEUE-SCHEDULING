# MULTI-LEVEL-QUEUE-SCHEDULING
With our project “Multilevel queue scheduling” we were able to learn many new concept and implementation of different scheduling methods.  For this project, each teammate tried to implement three different scheduling method for multilevel queue scheduling. We have tried Round Robin, FCFS, Priority Scheduling algorithms. Through this assignment we got an opportunity to become fluent in C and C++.
